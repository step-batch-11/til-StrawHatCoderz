# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
  - ReadableStream.pipeTo(), ReadableStream.pipeThrough()
- What changed in your understanding?
  - streams are not only for shell, they also work same for deno also using deno
    readble and writeable streams
  - asyncronous iterators
- What would you explain differently now?
  - Iterators can be implemented async also that's why we are use async for of
    for asyncronous iterators

---

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - asyncronous iterators
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - ReadableStream.pipeTo(), ReadableStream.pipeThrough()
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  - ReadableStream.locked, WritableStream.locked

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- "what is readableStream locked, why it is behaving differently in deno"
- "how to implement asyncronous iteratiors"
- “How to implement our own readble and writebles”

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet

  ```
    const writableStream = new WritableStream(
    {
      write(chunk) {
        const textElement = document.getElementById("text-output");
        textElement.textContent += chunk;
      },
    },
  );

  const writer = writableStream.getWriter();

  try {
    writer.write("Hello, ");
    writer.write("world!\n");
    writer.write("This has been a demo!\n");

    await writer.close(); // wait for all chunks to be written
    console.log("All chunks written");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Stream error: ", error);
  }
  ```
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because I get to know more about streams and their respective methods to work on.
